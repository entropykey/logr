## This project is under construction and very bare bones so yeah..

`ls -l /dev/input/by-path/` to figure out the keyboard

`gcc -O2 -o logger logger.c `

then run `sudo ./logger /dev/input/eventX`

then it would start the logger and record the keystrokes in keystrokes.log
and it is consensual for ethical purposes for now xD
